        <h1> Pre-Season Library Programs (June 21, August 24) </h1>
        <p> Each year, while school is out, we conduct 2-3 STEM summer programs at the library focused on the engineering design process. This summer, we hosted a Rube Goldberg inspired program as well as a Rubber Band Powered Cars program. The focus was to make sure kids had fun while simultaneously gathering knowledge about real world applications for engineering.  </p>

        <h1>Destroy Your Hard Drive Fundraiser (December 9)</h1>
        <p> This event is our biggest annual fundraiser: Destroy Your Hard Drive. We charge $20 to destroy peopleâ€™s hard drives while we put our robot on display and talk to community members about FIRST, FTC, and our ongoing season. We have a projector with a rotating slideshow of pictures in the back. This is an annual season highlight for us, and we are happy to have raised $1400
through the event this year. </p>
